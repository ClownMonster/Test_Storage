			<h3>Kali Linux Default Passwords</h3>
			<p>
			During installation, Kali Linux allows users to configure a password for the root user. However, should you decide to boot the live image instead, the i386, amd64, and ARM images are configured with the default root password – “toor“, without the quotes.
